  Welcome to my blog, this blog will have a mix of the regular "tech tutorials" i find as interesting topics, 
  blended with some of my own opinions and predictions.
</p>


## Myself

I am Gal Sagie, a husband and a proud father that is lucky enough to have my greatest
hobby as my work.

I am a passionate software developer and architect specializing in networking layers and products.

Have been dealing with a wide range of topics in the networking world from performance and scale to
security and cloud.

In recent years i have been (like the rest of the world) involed with SDN, NFV and Network Virtualization from all
aspects (Performance / Managment / Monitoring / Deployment).

Learning new things every day and enjoying it, interesting times in the networking world.

## Thanks

I want to mention Scott Lowe, his professional blog and writing is what inspired me to
write this blog, i am a regular visitor and reader and enjoying it.

Thanks Scott, keep up the good work!

(p.s. using Jekyll and Git Pages for this blog including this theme are also inspired from Scott :) )
